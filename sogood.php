Right now there are people without access to some very basic human needs: clean water, education, large scale disease prevention, agriculture and fundamental human rights. We accomplish this by working with next generation nonprofits that deliver tangible results.<br/><br/><a href="npos.php" title="Check out the awesome nonprofits we work with!">Check out the Nonprofits ></a></p></p>

Stores currently enabled for our social good program are marked with a heart. Don't even worry about it, we'll manage the relationships, you just sit back and shop. <!-- We have the chance to power one of the greatest social good movements in history through the colossus that is online retail.  How? Use the anvil, it's that simple. A small change in how you shop online can help power a massive shift in social good. where you start your online shopping adventures enables great change globally. So, where to start?-->  Remember to bookmark the anvil or make it your homepage. <!--, then just shop through pungle and we'll take care of the rest.< or even put a shortcut on your desktop if you're into that sort of thing. The anvil exists, but without someone striking down upon it with a hammer, nothing happens.--><br/><br/><a href="anvil.php" title="The Anvil beckons you.">Let's head over to The Anvil ></a></p></p>

            	<p class="align_justify">Fundamental human rights include a secure livelihood, basic social services, safety, a voice, and equality. For clean water, wells are just the start. Water projects lead to sanitation training, installed latrines and simple hand-washing stations. By building schools, a dedication to lasting education remains a part of our campaign. Concerning global health, malaria is a big problem with a simple solution, bed nets.  The nets can reduce transmission of malaria by as much as 90%.  As for agricultural development, small-scale farmers around the world receive supplies and support for developing sustainable farming methods.  We want to see actual results and not just a dollar amount being thrown at a problem. <!-- Rather than just throwing money at charities, we're going to hold them accountable for results!--><br/><br/><a href="progress.php" title="How are we going to get there?
