        		<b>How do I know if it's working?</b><br/>
        		If the store loads, it's working! Your job is to shop, our job is to take care of all the behind the scene details. Have fun!
      		</p>
      		<br/>
      		<p>
        		<b>What if the store I want to shop at isn't listed?</b><br/>
        		Just let us know and we'll start working towards building a relationship with your favorite store and get them on the anvil ASAP.
      		</p>
      		<br/>
      		<p>
        		<b>Can I shop at stores that don't have a heart?</b><br/>
        		Stores with a heart are the only ones currently contributing to our social good campaign, however, this changes on a day to day basis. For the most part, you should just pick your favorite stores and let us manage the relationships! It's more important that you remember to always shop through the anvil.
      		</p>
      		<br/>
      		<p>
        		<b>What exactly does social good enabled mean?</b><br/>
        		That in some way the vendor is contributing to our social good campaign when you visit their site through our anvil tool. The details can vary greatly depending on the vendor and our arrangement with them.
      		</p>
      		<br/>
      		<p>
        		<b>How much money does each store earn for social good?</b><br/>
        		That's top secret! :p The truth is, every store is different and some arrangements are fairly complicated. In the interest of fairness between stores, we're choosing to keep this information confidential. Any support from a vendor earns them a red heart.
      		</p>

        		<b>What causes are you currently supporting?</b><br/>
        		Check out our <a href="/social-good/cause-portfolio/" title="See what Nonprofits we currently fund.">cause portfolio</a> for up to date distribution ratios.
      		</p>
      		<br/>
      		<p>
        		<b>What progress has been made so far?</b><br/>
        		Great question, see our <a href="/social-good/goals-progress/" title="Check out our goals and track our progress.">goals & progress</a> page for more information!
      		</p>
      		<br/>
      		<p>
      			<b>How do I know you're not hoarding all the money?</b><br/>
      			We're a legitimate business in Seattle, WA. You can view actual results on our <a href="/social-good/goals-progress/" title="Check out our goals and track our progress.">goals & progress</a> page. Also, we're pretty transparent with who's who on our <a href="/about-us/" title="Who?">about us</a> page. If you're still in doubt, visit our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pungleDOTorg" target="_blank" title="pungle facebook">facebook page</a> and ask our crazy fans if we're trustworthy.

      		<p>
      			<b>Can I deduct for pungling on my taxes?</b><br/>
      			Sorry, social good is a gesture, not an actual donation and isn't tax deductable. You'll have to do it the old fashioned way, donate your own money (which is tax deductable) to a charity directly.
      		</p>
      		<br/>
      		<p>
        		<b>Can I donate to pungle?</b><br/>
        		Thanx for asking, but we don't take donations. We'll have some swag up pretty soon. Also coming soon is the ability to donate directly to the charities for our specific campaigns.
      		</p>
      		<br/>
      		<p>
        		<b>This is crazy exciting, how else can I help?</b><br/>
        		First, make sure you 'like' our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pungleDOTorg" target="_blank" title="pungle facebook">facebook page</a> to stay updated. Next, get your friends and family involved, <b>share pungle</b> with anyone that will listen.
