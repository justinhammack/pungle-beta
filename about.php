            	<p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> pungle is revolutionizing business by measuring our worth in social good. We don't answer to a board of directors, investors, or stockholders. Instead we value our success in terms of high impact donations from pungle's profits. <a href="/cause-portfolio/" title="Check it out!">Results Portfolio</a>.<!--We're asking that you join us in a social good movement by shopping more responsibly; vote for change with your wallet. Then just sit back, relax and partake in our delectable culture.--></p>
            	<p><strong>For-Profit vs Non-Profit:</strong> We're a for-profit business. Being for-profit allows us to build a stronger business: exponential growth, better customer service, top talent employees and a lot more flexibility. Profitability is our donation power. It also lets us challenge the relationship between companies and nonprofits in the 21st century.</p>
            	<p><strong>Ethics:</strong> We aren't perfect, but we're trying to do the right thing. We strive to do business in a more enlightened way, where we take responsibility for the impact of our business on society and the environment.</p>
            	<p><strong>Finding Causes:</strong> We look for a purity / focus in the scope of the cause, it must also be scalable, innovative and speak towards opportunity rather than guilt. We work directly with <a href="http://www.jolkona.org/" target="_blank" alt="Jolkona">Jolkona</a> to verify the impact of our donations.</p>
            	<p><strong>So what does pungle mean?</strong> It means to make a contribution, plus it sounds catchy.</p>
